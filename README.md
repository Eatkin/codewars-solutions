# Codewars Solutions

## About

This is a collection of coding problems I've solved on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/about).

Problems are organised into folders based on language and have their difficulty appended to the end of the filename (8kyu = easiest, 1kyu = hardest).

Each solution will have a link to its source at the top.

Some solutions are refactored for improvements or for fun, and these will have v2, v3, etc. appended to the filename to denote them.
